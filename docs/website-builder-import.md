# Website Builder Import

## Purpose

This module brings the local-first Website Builder path into `ruflo` without depending on Domits PMS data or the existing property-bound backend contract.

## Current shape

The imported `ruflo` app is intentionally:

- local-first
- browser-storage backed
- template-driven
- preview-oriented
- not published
- not domain-aware

It does **not** claim that a real website record, custom domain, or live booking funnel exists yet.

## Source material

The current implementation was shaped from the Domits Website Builder contract and source references:

- `docs/internal/context/domits_vault/03_Capabilities/Direct_Booking_Website.md`
- `docs/internal/context/domits_vault/02_Codex_Context/Direct_Booking_Website_Current_Task.md`
- `docs/internal/apis/directbookingwebsite/direct_booking_website_handoff.md`
- `docs/internal/apis/directbookingwebsite/direct_booking_website_frontend_status.md`
- `frontend/web/src/features/hostdashboard/website/websiteTemplates.js`
- `frontend/web/src/features/hostdashboard/website/websiteEditorConfig.js`
- `frontend/web/src/features/hostdashboard/website/rendering/WebsiteTemplatePreview.jsx`
- `frontend/web/src/features/hostdashboard/website/rendering/templateRegistry.js`
- `frontend/web/src/features/hostdashboard/website/rendering/websiteDraftContentOverrides.js`

## What is in `ruflo` now

- dedicated Website Builder app under `apps/website-builder`
- isolated static dev server via `npm run website-builder:dev`
- local-first design library and website workspace persistence in browser `localStorage`
- draft JSON export/import
- shared template socket through a registry that selects:
  - template metadata
  - template seed
  - template editor sections
  - template renderer
- Panorama Landing refactored into `src/templates/panorama`
- Trust Signals imported as the second real template with its own preview/editor flow
- shared builder config split away from template-local editor config
- overview workspace with:
  - reusable design library
  - saved websites
  - builder tab
- full-page preview route via `preview.html`
- editor-first local draft flow without the earlier setup overlay
- hero text alignment control for Panorama
- section-level visibility controls inside their corresponding editor sections
- preview-to-editor and editor-to-preview navigation targeting
- preview scroll-reveal motion closer to the Domits experience

## Template architecture

The builder now treats each template as a module that plugs into a shared base structure:

- `src/template-registry.js` is the socket layer
- `src/templates/<template-id>/seed.js` owns mock data for that template
- `src/templates/<template-id>/editor-config.js` owns template-specific editor sections
- `src/templates/<template-id>/render.js` owns preview markup/behavior
- `src/templates/shared/*` holds shared field factories and shared builder helpers

This is the shape future templates should follow. A new template should not be added as a placeholder card or a generic render variant. It should only enter the registry once it brings over:

- its real preview structure
- its real editor coverage
- its own seed/config module
- working preview/editor targeting

## Product direction

The builder should not only store finished websites. It should store two different layers of output:

- reusable website designs
  - mock-data presets
  - built to be reused later by Claude Design before generating a completely new concept
  - useful when multiple strong candidate designs should be shown to a business first
- company-specific websites
  - actual working drafts for a specific business
  - should swap mock content for real company information
  - can start from a reusable design instead of from zero

This split reduces token waste because Claude can iterate through already-approved design candidates before spending tokens on a brand-new website direction.

## Current local model

The current local-first workspace now behaves like this:

- `Design library`
  - reusable design presets with mock content
  - saved by template
  - previewable and editable
  - can be turned into a website draft
- `My websites`
  - company-specific website drafts
  - can reference a source design
  - previewable and editable
- `Builder`
  - current working session
  - can be saved into either collection

## Persistence next step

The next persistence step should be Supabase, but not as a raw browser mirror. The right shape is:

- `website_designs`
  - reusable design presets
  - template id
  - title
  - summary
  - mock-data draft payload
- `websites`
  - company-specific drafts
  - optional source design id
  - company metadata
  - website draft payload
- later optionally `website_revisions`
  - if revision history or rollback becomes important

Until that Supabase layer is wired, local storage remains the temporary adapter.

## What is intentionally excluded for now

- property import from Domits PMS
- property-bound backend draft persistence
- published live-site lifecycle
- fallback-domain behavior
- analytics ingestion
- guest checkout, quote, booking, and confirmation

## Next product step

When Supabase persistence is ready, this app should swap its storage adapter first instead of growing more logic on top of browser-local storage. Additional website templates can come back later, but only after each one is imported with its real editor and preview behavior instead of placeholder variants.
