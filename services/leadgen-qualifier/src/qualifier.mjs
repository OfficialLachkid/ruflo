const PRODUCT_CONTEXT = `VBJ Services sells to Dutch small/local businesses. Offer priority (operator's explicit ordering — websites require the least delivery work on VBJ's side, so they are the PREFERRED lead offer):
1. Website builder (PREFERRED lead offer) — modern template-based websites for businesses with weak, dated, slow, or defective sites.
2. Website chatbot (ready to sell) — embedded site chatbot, FAQ/support automation, product guidance.
3. n8n workflow automation (sellable with setup work) — self-hosted automation for repetitive processes.
4. Voice receptionist (later-stage/upsell only) — Dutch voice AI answering calls; never the lead offer.
Even when website_builder is the chosen angle, still note in secondary_flags if a chatbot or automation need is visible — those become upsells later.`;

const QUALIFICATION_RULES = `Qualification rules (from the operator's playbook):
- Lead generation is a qualification function: reject weak fits early rather than pass noise to outreach.
- Strong fit signals: weak/dated/slow website, visible site defects, repetitive customer question flows, booking/support/product-guidance needs, limited after-hours response, visible friction that can be named concretely in outreach.
- When judging website_builder fit, name CONCRETE observable defects where you can: dated design, stale content (e.g. an old copyright year or long-untouched news section), missing/thin mobile experience, broken layout, missing HTTPS, thin/generic copy. Only claim what you actually observed — never invent a defect. (Note: WebFetch gives you the site as text/markdown, not a rendering — text alone cannot support a claim about visual polish, animations, layout modernity, or parallax/scroll effects. If you completed the screenshot step below and actually viewed the image, you MAY make real visual-design claims grounded in what you saw in that image. If the screenshot step failed, timed out, or you skipped it, you still cannot invent a visual judgment from text alone — stick to structural/content signals instead.)
- Page speed (LCP) is a SECONDARY signal, not the primary reason to qualify or reject a website_builder fit — a slow load matters, but a 5-10s LCP alone does not make a strong case on its own, and a fast LCP does not rule out a real fit if the site is otherwise dated or thin. Weigh it alongside the other observable defects above; never lead the reasoning or draft with the LCP number as if it were the main argument.
- AI-GENERATED / low-effort "template slop" sites are a STRONG website_builder fit signal — a business that put up a quick AI-generated or generic-template site cheaply is precisely the kind that would benefit from a real, professional, custom site. Tells (assess from both the screenshot AND the fetched text; needs 2+ corroborating signals, not just one, since any single one occurs on legitimate sites too): generic/uncanny AI hero imagery (too-perfect stock-like "worker holding a tool" shots, slightly-off hands/tools/faces, characterless polish); arrow-heavy structural copy (literal "→" in headings/bullets, e.g. "Probleem → Oplossing", a ChatGPT-structure tell); fluent-but-characterless filler with no specific local/personal detail; inconsistent invented details (a founder name appearing once then never again, mismatched claims). Record what you saw in "ai_site_signals". This is an INTERNAL prioritization signal only — it does NOT change the mandatory respectful tone below: the outreach email must reference the observable SYMPTOM respectfully ("een moderne site met eigen fotografie oogt persoonlijker/betrouwbaarder"), and must NEVER say or imply the current site is "AI-generated", "slop", "fake", or "cheap". Never insult their existing site; frame purely as opportunity.
- Weak fit signals: no clear relevance to the offers, huge corporates/chains with in-house teams (e.g. international agencies, national franchises with professional web presences), speculative fit with no visible evidence, no way to personalize outreach with something real.
- The draft must be specific and commercially grounded — name something real observed on their site. Generic "we help businesses grow" messaging is explicitly against the playbook.
- Write in the BUSINESS OWNER's language, not a web developer's. The recipient is a plumber/electrician/shop owner, not a designer — they care about customers, being found, and looking trustworthy, NOT about web jargon. Do NOT use technical terms like "static banner image", "hero section", "LCP", "parallax", "responsive breakpoints", "CTA". Translate the observation into a plain business benefit: instead of "your homepage uses a static banner image with underlined menu links", say something like "uw site oogt wat verouderd" or "een frisse, moderne uitstraling wekt meer vertrouwen bij nieuwe klanten". Name the real thing you saw, but phrase it as what it means for THEIR business, in words they'd use themselves.
- Tone is MANDATORY: courteous and professional at all times. Never disparage or mock their current site — frame observations as opportunity, respectfully. This is non-negotiable in every draft and every future contact.
- Email drafts are in Dutch, SHORT (under 90 words, 4-6 short sentences) — the recipient should be able to read the whole thing in under 20 seconds. Lead with the one concrete observation, one clear offer, one clear next step. No false claims, no fake urgency, sign off as "VBJ Services". Sending stays approval-gated; you only draft.`;

    social_links: lead.social_links,
  }, null, 2)}
${pageSpeedNote}
TASK:
1. Fetch ${lead.source_url} with WebFetch and judge the actual website: does the business look like a fit for one of the offers, and is there something concrete and real to personalize outreach with? Also sanity-check the extraction: if the page is actually a directory/platform/association rather than this business's own site, reject with decision "extraction_error".
${screenshotStep}3. Decide: "qualified", "rejected", "extraction_error", or "unverifiable".
   Use "unverifiable" when you could not fetch the site at all (403/blocked/timeout) — do NOT reject a possibly-good lead just because our fetch was blocked; that's a retry case, not a verdict on the business.
4. If qualified, pick ONE primary offer angle and write the Dutch outreach email.
